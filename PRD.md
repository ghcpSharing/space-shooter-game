# Space Shooter Game PRD

Create an engaging arcade-style space shooter game where players pilot a spaceship to destroy incoming enemies and survive as long as possible.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Responsive** - Controls feel immediate and precise, creating satisfying gameplay feedback
2. **Intense** - Fast-paced action with escalating difficulty that keeps players on edge
3. **Nostalgic** - Classic arcade aesthetics that evoke retro gaming memories

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Game combines shooting mechanics, enemy spawning, collision detection, and score tracking with persistent high scores

## Essential Features

**Spaceship Movement**
- Functionality: Arrow keys or WASD control spaceship movement within screen boundaries
- Purpose: Core player interaction and positioning for strategic gameplay
- Trigger: Keyboard input detection
- Progression: Key press → movement validation → position update → screen boundary check
- Success criteria: Smooth movement with no screen boundary violations

**Projectile Shooting**
- Functionality: Spacebar fires bullets from player's position upward
- Purpose: Primary offensive mechanism against enemies
- Trigger: Spacebar key press with cooldown timer
- Progression: Key press → cooldown check → create bullet → add to scene → move upward
- Success criteria: Consistent firing rate with visible projectiles

**Enemy Spawning**
- Functionality: Enemies spawn from top of screen at random intervals and positions
- Purpose: Provides targets and creates escalating challenge
- Trigger: Timer-based spawning with increasing frequency
- Progression: Timer expires → random position selection → enemy creation → downward movement
- Success criteria: Continuous enemy flow with increasing difficulty over time

**Collision Detection**
- Functionality: Detect bullet-enemy and player-enemy collisions
- Purpose: Core game mechanics for scoring and game over conditions
- Trigger: Physics overlap detection between game objects
- Progression: Objects overlap → collision detected → destroy objects → update score/health
- Success criteria: Accurate collision detection with immediate visual feedback

**Score System**
- Functionality: Points awarded for destroying enemies, high score persistence
- Purpose: Player progression tracking and replay motivation
- Trigger: Enemy destruction events
- Progression: Enemy destroyed → points calculated → score updated → high score check → persistence
- Success criteria: Accurate scoring with persistent high score storage

## Edge Case Handling

- **Rapid Fire Spam**: Cooldown timer prevents bullet spam and maintains game balance
- **Screen Boundary**: Player movement constrained to visible game area
- **Multiple Collisions**: Proper cleanup prevents duplicate collision events
- **Game Pause**: Space bar toggles pause state without interfering with shooting
- **Performance**: Object pooling for bullets and enemies to prevent memory issues

## Design Direction

The design should feel retro and arcade-inspired with crisp pixel-perfect graphics, creating an authentic classic gaming experience that's both nostalgic and modern.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme using classic space/neon colors to create vibrant contrast against dark space background.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Space Blue (oklch(0.15 0.1 240)) - Main background communicating the vastness of space
- **Secondary Colors**: Bright Green (oklch(0.7 0.15 120)) for player ship and UI elements, Electric Blue (oklch(0.6 0.2 200)) for projectiles and effects
- **Accent Color**: Neon Orange (oklch(0.75 0.2 40)) - Enemy highlights and explosion effects for high visibility and danger communication
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Deep Space Blue): White text (oklch(0.95 0 0)) - Ratio 12.1:1 ✓
  - Primary (Bright Green): Black text (oklch(0.1 0 0)) - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Neon Orange): Black text (oklch(0.1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.7:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Bold, geometric sans-serif fonts that communicate precision and futuristic technology while maintaining excellent readability for game UI elements.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Game Title): Orbitron Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Score Display): Orbitron Medium/24px/normal spacing  
  - Body (Instructions): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed spacing
  - Small (HUD Elements): Inter Medium/14px/tight spacing

## Animations

Smooth and functional animations that enhance gameplay feedback without distracting from core mechanics, focusing on impact effects and movement fluidity.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Particle effects for explosions reinforce successful hits, smooth movement transitions maintain game flow
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Player ship has subtle hover animation, bullets have trailing effects, enemies have entry animations, explosions are prominent and satisfying

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Custom Phaser game canvas component integrated with React, Card components for game UI overlay, Button components for game controls
- **Customizations**: Phaser game scene manager, custom sprite classes for game objects, particle system for effects
- **States**: Game states (menu, playing, paused, game over), button states for controls, animated sprites for characters
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for UI controls (play, pause, restart), custom pixel art sprites for game objects
- **Spacing**: Consistent 8px grid system for UI elements, precise pixel positioning for game objects
- **Mobile**: Touch controls overlay for mobile devices, responsive canvas scaling, portrait/landscape orientation support
